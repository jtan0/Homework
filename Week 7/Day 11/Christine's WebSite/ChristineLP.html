		<h4>The Classic Fall Look with Teresa Vu</h4>
			<p>
				It was so much fun doing Teresa’s makeup! Look how beautiful she is! This look can simply be an everyday wear or for a fun girls-night-out! For her makeup, I decided to do a classic fall look and used cool tones for the transformation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Foundation: I used Revlon Colorstay in medium beige and applied it all over her face with a beauty blender.
			</p>
			<p>
				Concealer: Conceal under-eye areas using a concealer brush and blending it out with a beauty blender. Remember ladies, if you want to really brighten and highlight your face, you must apply the concealer outwards in a downward triangular motion. Here is a simple face chart to show you how to highlight and contour the correct way. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Eyebrows: The Anastasia Brow Wiz is by far my favorite eyebrow pencil when it comes to having the perfect brows! I simply used the brow pencil in the shade medium brown and started to draw the shape following her natural brow line.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eyeshadow: This is the fun part! I love the colors in the Carli Bybel palette! It is a must-have especially when you like the neutral shades and  pigmented colors.  For the eyes, I applied a brow bone color to the lid from the  Carli palette and started blending it with a blending brush. Take a crease brush, find the hollow areas of the eyes and start to pack a taupe color to the outer-corners.

		<h4>Brown Lips</h4>
			<p>
				I love dark lip colors, although I don’t wear it often, I am very particular of which color I choose. Dark colors can be tricky and may look different on everyone depending on your skin tone, however, but it never hurts to try it out and see if the a dark color looks good on you! 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since this topic is about dark lip colors, my obsession right now is Kylie Jenner’s brown lip. I saw the picture on her Instagram and just had to try it! Luckily, I was able to find a dark brown shade at Ulta! Their products tend to run out quick and I snatched the last NYX lip liner in Espresso and the NYX cream matte lipstick in London! Here is the final look… it is a little different than Kylie’s with a lighter shade and more of a chocolate brown, but I love it!
